# Relational Database Design

In this project, I tackled the challenge of organizing various users, roles, user accounts, and their statuses into separate tables. By carefully defining relations and attributes, establishing primary keys, and creating foreign keys, I ensured the integrity of the data and optimized its management.

One of the key aspects of the project was inserting data into the tables, with at least two rows in each table. By paying attention to the relationships between the tables, I ensured the creation of proper foreign key constraints, thus maintaining data consistency and accuracy.

Additionally, I highlighted the importance of proper data management, including the ability to delete all data from the tables when necessary. This ensures a clean and organized database, ready for future data operations.

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of relational database design principles, honed my SQL skills, and strengthened my ability to ensure data integrity.
